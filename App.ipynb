The Supreme Court however granted relief to them by directing that \\nthey shall be considered by the \\nCommission and the State Government, \\nand would be appointed if otherwise found suitable and eligible. The said decision was rendered in Sheo Shyam & \\nOrs. Vs. State of U.P. & Ors., (2004) 2 \\nESC 256. The Supreme Court in the said \\ndecision held that the life of the waiting list which is of one year should be reckoned from the last date when the \\nrecommendation was made by the State \\nGovernment. However, in view of the fact \\nthat after the decision of the Commission not to send the names to the State Government as the waiting list had expired, which decision was the subject matter of the writ petition before the High Court, the State Government itself had sent a requisition of 56 posts, including 11 posts to which the dispute related, and examinations were held subsequently on 9th November, 2003, the Supreme Court observed that the career of 11 candidates cannot be jeopardised, and therefore in these peculiar circumstances, it directed that the appointment shall be considered \\nby the Commission and the State \\nGovernment.  \\n \\n3.  Learned counsel for the \\npetitioners submitted that the same relief \\nshould be granted to the petitioners. From \\na perusal of the judgment of the Supreme \\nCourt we find that because of the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case that the Supreme Court had granted relief to the 11 appellants only. The Supreme \\nCourt could have granted relief to all the \\ncandidates in the waiting list subject to \\nthe availability of the vacancies.  \\n \\n4.  In the State of Kerla Vs. Kumari \\nT.P. Roshana & Ors., AIR 1979 SC 765, the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court considered this aspect and observed as under:-  \\n \\n\"The root of the grievance and the \\nfruit of the writ are not individual but collective and while the \\'\\'adversary system\\' makes the Judge a mere umpire, \\ntraditionally speaking, the community \\norientation of the judicial function, so \\ndesirable in the Third World remedial jurisprudence, transforms the Court\\'s power into affirmative structuring of \\nredress so as to make it personally \\nmeaningful and socially relevant. \\nFrustration of invalidity is part of the judicial duty; fulfilment of legality is complementary.

The measure is academic excellence, not litigating persistence. It will be thrown open to the first thirty strictly according to merit measure by marks secured.\"  \\n 5.  The same view has been \\nexpressed by the Apex Court in Ajay Hasia & Ors. Vs. Khalid Mujib \\nSehravardi & Ors., AIR 1981 SC 487; and \\nPunjab Engineering College, Chandigarh \\nVs. Sanjay Gulati & Ors., AIR 1983 SC 580. In Thaper Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala Vs. Abhinav Taneja \\n& Ors., (1990) 3 SCC 468, the Apex court \\nconsidered a case where the High Court \\nhad issued directions to admit the students who had approached the writ Court, '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Case-Test.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='2 All]                     Manoj Kumar Pandey and others V. State of U.P. and another 595\\nignoring the merit of the students who had \\nnot approached the Court.  \\n \\nThe Hon\\'ble Supreme Court \\nobserved as under:-  \\n \\n\"The High Court should have \\ndirected only two students to be admitted and that too on merit. Admittedly, there \\nwere more meritorious students than the \\nrespondents, waiting in queue. The High \\nCourt, thus, travelled beyond its jurisdiction and not only directed more students than the institute could absorb \\nbut also students who were less \\nmeritorious, to be admitted. No reasons \\nwhatsoever have been given by the High Court for exercising its extraordinary writ jurisdiction so peremptorily which has \\nresulted in injustice, both to the appellant-\\ninstitution as well as to the students who \\nstood higher in merit than all most all the respondent- students. We refrain from making any further comment on the impugned judgment.\"  \\n 6.  Similarly, general directions were \\nissued to give benefit to the students strictly in accordance with the merit, in Srawan Kumar & Ors Vs. Director General of Health Services & Ors, 1993 (Supp) 1 SCC 632. In K.C. Sharma & Ors. Vs. Union of India & Ors., (1997) 6 SCC 721, a Constitution Bench of the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court has considered \\nthe aspect of giving benefit to a particular \\nperson and refusal to grant such benefit \\nby the High Court to other similarly situated only on the ground that they had approached the Court at a belated stage. \\nThe Apex Court held that in such a case \\nthe judgement has to be rendered in rem \\nand benefit of the judgment should be given to all other similarly situated persons.  7.  However as seen above, the \\nSupreme Court in Sheo Shyam & Ors \\n(Supra) restricted the relief to 11 \\nappointments only. In this view of the \\nmatter we would not be justified in \\ngranting any relief to the petitioners. This \\napart, it must also be noticed that no specific averment has been made by the petitioners that their names were included \\nin the waiting list. All that they have \\nstated is that they expect that their names \\nwould be included in the waiting list.  \\n 8.  Further the present petitioners \\nhave filed this writ petition only in \\nSeptember, 2002 much after the expiry of \\none year from the date when the last recommendation was made on 26th July, 2001. This petition has been filed after the \\nlife of the waiting list came to an end. It is \\nsettled legal proposition that no relief can \\nbe granted to the candidate if he approaches the Court after expiry of the Select List. (Vide J. Ashok Kumar Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors., JT (1996) 3 SCC 225; State of Bihar & Ors. Vs. Md. Kalimuddin & Ors., AIR 1996 SC 1145; State of U.P. & Ors. Vs. Harish Chandra & Ors., AIR 1996 SC 2173; Sushma Suri Vs. Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi & Anr., (1999) 1 SCC 330; & State of U.P. & Ors. Vs. Ram Swarup Saroj, (2003) 3 SCC 699). It has been held therein that if the selection process is over, select list had expired and \\nappointments had been made, no relief \\ncan be granted by the Court at a belated \\nstage.  \\n 9.  The Hon\\'ble Apex Court while \\nconsidering the case has granted relief \\nonly to those persons who had approached \\nthe Court and those were the persons who had filed the writ petition before this Court within one year from the date on '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Case-Test.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='596                               INDIAN LAW REPORT S ALLAHABAD SERIES                            [2006  \\nwhich the last recommendation had been \\nmade. Therefore, those persons had \\napproached the Court when the select \\nlist/merit list was alive. The case of the \\npetitioners is quite distinguishable as they \\nhave approached this Court after more \\nthan two months of the expiry of the select list. Therefore, petitioners cannot claim the relief which had been granted to \\nother persons by the Hon\\'ble Apex Court.  \\n \\n10.  If some person has taken a relief \\nfrom this Court by filing a Writ Petition immediately after the cause of action had \\narisen, petitioners cannot take the benefit \\nthereof by filing a writ petition belatedly. \\nThey cannot take any benefit thereof at such a belated stage for the reason that they cannot be permitted to take the \\nimpetus of the order passed at the behest \\nof some diligent person.  \\n 11.  In State of Karnataka & Ors. Vs. \\nS.M. Kotrayya & Ors., (1996) 6 SCC 267, the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court rejected the contention that a petition should be considered ignoring the delay and laches on the ground that he filed the petition just after coming to know of the relief granted by the Court in a similar case as the same cannot furnish a proper explanation for delay and laches. The Court observed that such a plea is wholly unjustified and cannot furnish any ground for ignoring delay and laches.   \\n \\n12.  Same view has been reiterated \\nby the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court in Jagdish Lal & Ors. Vs. State of Haryana & Ors., AIR 1997 SC 2366, observing as under:-  \\n \\n\"Suffice it to state that appellants \\nmay be sleeping over their rights for long and elected to wake-up when they had impetus from Veerpal Chauhan and Ajit Singh\\'s ratio.... desperate attempts of the \\nappellants to re-do the seniority, held by \\nthem in various cadre.... are not amenable \\nto the judicial review at this belated stage. \\nThe High Court, therefore, has rightly \\ndismissed the writ petition on the ground \\nof delay as well.\"  \\n 13.  In M/s. Roop Diamonds & Ors. \\nVs. Union of India & Ors., AIR 1989 SC \\n674, the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court \\nconsidered a case where petitioner wanted to get the relief on the basis of the judgment of the Supreme Court wherein a \\nparticular law had been declared ultra \\nvires. The Court rejected the petition on \\nthe ground of delay and latches observing as under:-   \\n \\n\"There is one more ground which \\nbasically sets the present case apart. \\nPetitioners are re-agitating claims which they have not persued for several years. Petitioners were not vigilant but were content to be dormant and close to sit on the fence till somebody else\\'s case came to be decided.\"  \\n 14.  Thus, petitioner was not entitled \\nto claim any benefit of the said judgment of this Court.  \\n 15.  In view of the above, we are of \\nthe considered opinion that no relief can be granted to the petitioners. Petition \\nlacks merit and is accordingly dismissed.  \\n--------- \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n ')]"
